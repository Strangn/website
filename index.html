            <h2>ASK ME ANYTHING</h2>
            <p>
               I'm thirty years old and I have a four year old daughter. I like collecting cards and playing computer games in my free time, this is somewht concise in the matter of me dealing with a crashed computer. Thats cool. My new one is finally complete but I would much rather have waited than my old computer crash. All in all I have a 3070ti Founders Edition but that won't mean much if i can't get a job to keep the lights on.
